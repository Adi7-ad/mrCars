# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the mtcars Dataset

This project performs a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **mtcars dataset**, focusing on uncovering patterns and relationships between various car attributes like mileage (mpg), horsepower, weight, acceleration, and number of cylinders.

### Objectives 
- To understand the structure and distribution of the data.
- To analyze how features like weight, horsepower, and number of cylinders affect fuel efficiency.
- To visualize key relationships and identify any potential outliers or patterns.

### Key Insights
- **Cars with fewer cylinders (e.g., 4-cylinder)** tend to have **better mileage**.
- **Weight and horsepower** show a **strong negative correlation** with MPG.
- Powerful and heavier cars are generally less fuel-efficient.
- Feature engineering such as **power-to-weight ratio** adds more depth to the analysis.
- Visualizations like **pairplots**, **boxplots**, and **heatmaps** help in spotting trends and correlations.

### Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Outlier Detection and Visualization

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
